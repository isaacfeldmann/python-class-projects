-- course_catelog.py --
This project is a simple web scraper. The program takes the Mercyhurst University course catalog URL and fetches the name of each department. It then prompts the user to enter a department name. After entering the department name, all program names within that department are displayed, and the user is again prompted to choose one. After choosing one, the code outputs a link to the page about that particular program and all the classes that are associated with that program.

The program effectively shows how to use specific imports for opening a URL and fetching different tags in HTML. It also showcases my ability to analyze HTML to find where specific content is on a web page.
